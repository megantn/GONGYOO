## WHO IS GONG YOO?
gong yoo is a guy from that one kdrama called squid game. he's like pretty famous so he makes a cameo in the first episode.
he's also known as the love of my life.

## WHY IS HE SO COOL?
gong yoo approaches poor people and then offers to play a game for money. but since these people are poor, he says they can pay with their body. so he just slaps them a ton and looks cool :)

## WHAT GAME DOES GONG YOO PLAY WITH POOR PEOPLE? AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?
gong yoo plays a korean game called ddakji where there are two folded paper squares and the players take turns throwing one square at the only one on the ground with the goal of knocking the other one up and flipping it over. this matters a ton because gong yoo is just so cracked at the game and he looks so cool when he throws the paper really hard and owns his opponents.
